# TeamCode guide

The robot code is organized by responsibility so OpModes stay small and hardware or control logic
can be reused between TeleOp and Autonomous.

## How the code fits together

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `config` | Hardware-map names and tunable robot-wide values |
| `control` | Generic feedback controllers |
| `drive` | Hardware-independent drivetrain values and mecanum math |
| `localization` | Two-wheel odometry, IMU heading, Limelight AprilTag ranging, and pose models |
| `navigation` | Waypoints and field-to-robot pose control |
| `subsystems` | Classes that own and command physical robot hardware |
| `telemetry` | Driver Station and Dashboard presentation |
| `opmodes` | Match lifecycle and coordination of the other modules |

`LimelightTeleOp` reads the gamepad and passes movement commands to `MecanumDrive`.
`LimelightAutoNav` passes each `Waypoint` and the current `PoseEstimate` to
`HolonomicPoseController`, then sends the resulting drive command to `MecanumDrive`.
`RobotLocalization` updates two independent components. `TwoWheelOdometryLocalizer` uses the two
odometry pods for translation and the hub IMU for heading; together they are the only source of the
field pose used for navigation. `AprilTagTracker` uses Limelight only to measure each visible tag
relative to the robot; tag observations never modify the odometry pose.
`LocalizationTelemetry` displays both sets of data without coupling them to Driver Station or
Dashboard code.

## Robot configuration names

These names are case-sensitive and must exactly match the devices configured on the Robot
Controller. Change them in `RobotConfig.Hardware` if the configuration uses different names.

| Configured name | Type | Physical location and purpose | Software direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontLeft` | Motor | Front-left mecanum drive wheel | Forward |
| `frontRight` | Motor | Front-right mecanum drive wheel | Reversed |
| `backLeft` | Motor | Rear-left mecanum drive wheel | Forward |
| `backRight` | Motor | Rear-right mecanum drive wheel | Reversed |
| `odoForward` | Encoder motor port | Parallel odometry wheel | Positive when driving forward |
| `odoStrafe` | Encoder motor port | Perpendicular odometry wheel | Positive when moving left |
| `limelight` | Limelight 3A | Measures visible AprilTag range and relative height | Not applicable |
| `imu` | Control/Expansion Hub IMU | Supplies robot heading for two-wheel odometry | Not applicable |
| `intake` | Motor | Intake mechanism | Controlled by A and Y |
| `shooter` | Motor | Shooting mechanism | Controlled by X |
| `servoMotor` | Continuous-rotation servo | Auxiliary servo mechanism | Controlled by B |

The two right-side motors are reversed in `MecanumDrive`, allowing the same positive drive command
to move all four wheels forward. If a wheel spins the wrong way, first verify the physical motor
position and wiring before changing that direction rule.

The two odometry wheels are required by both current OpModes. Their encoder channels must be
configured as motors using the exact names above; they are read only and are never powered.

Tune each pod's ticks-per-inch and its offset from the robot center in `RobotConfig.Localization`.
`ODOMETRY_FORWARD_LATERAL_OFFSET_INCHES` is the forward pod's left/right offset;
`ODOMETRY_STRAFE_FORWARD_OFFSET_INCHES` is the strafe pod's forward/back offset. If an encoder
counts in the opposite direction, change its multiplier from `1.0` to `-1.0`. At heading 0°,
positive X is forward and positive Y is left. The autonomous route currently resets its starting
pose to `(0, 0, 0°)`.

Limelight reports tag poses in meters; `AprilTagTracker` converts them to inches. For every visible
tag, it provides forward and left offset, horizontal distance, straight-line 3D range, and signed
height relative to the robot origin. Accurate height values require the Limelight's position and
orientation to be configured correctly in the Limelight web interface.

## Driver controls

Both gamepads use the same robot-centric driving map:

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left stick Y | Drive forward/backward |
| Left stick X | Strafe left/right |
| Left trigger | Rotate left |
| Right trigger | Rotate right |
| Right stick | Unassigned |
| A | Toggle intake motor on/off |
| Y | Toggle intake direction forward/reverse |
| X | Run shooter while held |
| B | Toggle continuous-rotation servo on/off |

Gamepad 1 has priority whenever it has active drive input. When gamepad 1 is idle, gamepad 2 can
drive with the same controls. Inputs from the two controllers are never added together, and a 0.05
deadband removes small joystick drift. Telemetry identifies the controller currently in command.

In `Limelight TeleOp`, `TeleOpControlThreads` runs two independent 10 ms control loops. The drive
thread only reads movement inputs and writes drivetrain power. The mechanism thread separately
handles the intake, shooter, and servo buttons. A wait or timed sequence added to the mechanism
thread therefore does not pause drivetrain updates. The main OpMode thread continues localization
and telemetry. Stopping the OpMode—or an exception in either worker—signals both workers to stop
and sets all controlled motors and the servo to zero.

The mechanism buttons above apply to `Limelight TeleOp` on either gamepad. The
`Test: Odo vs AprilTag` diagnostic does not operate the mechanisms; in that OpMode, A captures a
baseline and B clears it. Pedro Pathing's generated `Tuning` OpMode retains its own controls and
does not use this shared mapping.

Mechanism power values are configured in `RobotConfig.Mechanisms`. The `servoMotor` mapping assumes
a continuous-rotation servo (`CRServo`); a positional servo would require on/off positions instead
of power values.

## Localization validation

Run the Driver Station OpMode `Test: Odo vs AprilTag` with a tag in view. Press A to capture that
tag as a fixed reference, then drive and rotate slowly while keeping it visible. The test converts
the baseline Limelight observation into field coordinates, uses subsequent odometry poses to
predict where the tag should appear relative to the robot, and compares that prediction with the
new Limelight observation. Telemetry reports detection rate, distance error, robot-relative
position error, height drift, and a live PASS/FAIL result. Press B to clear the baseline.

The default pass limits are 3 inches of planar position error and 2 inches of height drift. Adjust
the `VALIDATION_*_TOLERANCE_INCHES` constants only after measuring the physical system's normal
noise. This is a relative-motion consistency test; an accurate absolute field pose still depends on
proper odometry calibration and a correct Limelight camera transform.

Desktop geometry tests can be run with:

```shell
./gradlew :TeamCode:testDebugUnitTest
```

## Dependency direction

OpModes compose subsystems and services. Hardware-independent math does not import OpModes, and
subsystems do not read gamepads or write telemetry. Keep new mechanisms behind a subsystem class,
put reusable control math in `control` or `navigation`, and expose hardware names/tuning through
`RobotConfig`.

Pedro Pathing's generated tuning suite remains in `pedroPathing`; it is vendor-oriented setup code
and is intentionally separate from the robot architecture above.
